# Summary
I change all the nonsemantic html tags and change them to 
semantic tags such as nav, aside, section, header and footer. 
I added accessible alt attributes to all the images. In the section 
class search-engine-optimization, I gave it an id. With the id being 
added, search engine optimization has a function in the nav bar. 
By clicking search engine optimization, it will take you to the 
search engine optimization section of the page. In the CSS page I change
the divs to elements as well as condensing the CSS.
